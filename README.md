Hello!

To start use this app please clone and after that write the command "npm install" in the main diractory.
Than you can run the app by the command "npm start" and the app will run locally (localhost:3000).

you can run test by the command "npm test"

you can make the request with the react frontend "localhost:3000/"

Also, you can make the request directly from: 
"localhost:3000/api/math/{mathOperator}?firstNumber={firstNumber}&secondNumber={secondNumber}"

The allowed math operators are: ADD, SUBTRACK, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE. other will get error 400.
you can only pass numbers in query, otherwise you will get error 400.

Enjoy! 
contact me if there are any problems.
